A couple tools for packing and unpacking GameFont.tga from Civilization IV.

1. `atlast.html`, in this directory, is a standalone offline cloud-free
   web-scale web page for generating the text portion of the GameFont.tga
   atlas.

2. Also here is the source code for a program written in Rust for packing and
   unpacking GameFont.tga. Unpacking means breaking the atlas down into
   individual .png files, while packing is just reassembling a
   GameFont.tga atlas from an index of those individual images.

   The idea is it's easier to edit a GameFont.tga by working with individual
   images and a manifest of the images and their ordering.

An example:

```
$ atlast.exe --unpack "C:\Games\Sid Meier's Civilization IV Beyond the Sword\Beyond the Sword\Mods\Realism Invictus\Assets\res\Fonts\GameFont.tga"
[0.000s] loading C:\Games\Sid Meier's Civilization IV Beyond the Sword\Beyond the Sword\Mods\Realism Invictus\Assets\res\Fonts\GameFont.tga to unpack to GameFont...
[0.002s] found 658 images over 14 rows
[0.000s] saving to GameFont...
[0.149s] writing GameFont\index.html
[0.001s] done unpacking to GameFont
```

This creates a directory called GameFont and unpacks the atlas into it, also
writing an index.html file used as a listing of the atlas images. You can
"preview" the atlas by opening the index.html file in your browser, or edit it
with a text file to modify the listing. The index.html is used later to pack a
GameFont.tga.

```
$ atlast.exe --unpack custom-GameFont-text-altas.tga --output GameFont --patch-index
[0.000s] loading custom-GameFont-text-altas.tga to unpack to GameFont...
[0.001s] found 181 images over 4 rows
[0.000s] saving to GameFont...
[0.037s] patching GameFont\index.html
[0.002s] matched 181 <img>s
[0.000s] done unpacking to GameFont
```

Using custom-GameFont-text-atlas.tga generated by atlast.html from the
paragraph above, we can unpack it to the directory created from the unpack
before. But this .tga only contains the text portion, the first 181 images.
This way, we replace the original text with our own.

Instead of overwriting the index.html, the --patch-index option says that when
each image is written we look for a corresponding img tag in index.html (with a
matching src attribute) and update it's baseline marker data. Without this,
and unpacking the images from our generated atlas alone, would mean that
letters might be rendered in funny places and be vertically misaligned in the
repacked GameFont.tga.

```
$ atlast.exe --pack GameFont --size 2046x540 --output "C:\Games\Sid Meier's Civilization IV Beyond the Sword\Beyond the Sword\Mods\Realism Invictus\Assets\res\Fonts\GameFont.tga"
[0.000s] packing images under GameFont to C:\Games\Sid Meier's Civilization IV Beyond the Sword\Beyond the Sword\Mods\Realism Invictus\Assets\res\Fonts\GameFont.tga
[0.001s] loading 658 images...
[0.059s] packed 2046x540
[0.004s] written to C:\Games\Sid Meier's Civilization IV Beyond the Sword\Beyond the Sword\Mods\Realism Invictus\Assets\res\Fonts\GameFont.tga
```

Repack the images specified in GameFont/index.html to the game's GameFont.tga
at the path specified. The size option ensures the image is exactly that size.
I've found this important for the GameFont_75.tga file as it _seems_ to need to
be a very specific size to work, even if it's mostly empty.
